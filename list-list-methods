1. The given Python code defines a list numbers with five elements
 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Then, it assigns the value 6 to the element at index 4 
(which is the fifth element in the list since Python uses zero-based indexing). 
After this assignment, the list numbers will look like this: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6].

Finally, it prints the element at index 4 using print(numbers[4]). The element 
at index 4 in the modified list is 6.

So, the output of the code will be:

6

It tells us that the value at index 4 of the numbers list is 6.

2. The given Python code is working with a list called list1, and it is using 
slicing to extract a sublist from list1. Let's break down the code:

    list1 = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]: This line initializes a list called list1 with 
five elements [10, 11, 12, 13, 14].

    print(list1[::3]): This line uses slicing to create a new list based on list1. 
The slicing syntax [start:stop:step] is used here.
        start is not specified, so it defaults to the beginning of the list (index 0).
        stop is not specified, so it defaults to the end of the list (index 5).
        step is specified as 3, which means it will select every third element 
starting from the beginning.

So, the code list1[::3] selects elements from list1 with a step of 3, starting 
from the beginning. Here's how it works:

    Element at index 0: 10
    Skip two elements
    Element at index 3: 13

So, the output of the code will be:

csharp

[10, 13]

It tells us that the result of list1[::3] is a new list containing [10, 13], which
 are the elements at indices 0 and 3 of list1.

3. What will be the output of below Python code?

list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(list1[4])



The given Python code defines a list list1 with five elements [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 
and then it prints the element at index 4.

In Python, list indexing is zero-based, meaning the first element of the list is at
 index 0, the second element is at index 1, and so on. Therefore, when you access list1[4], 
you are retrieving the element at the fifth position in the list.

4. Which of the following will reverse list1=[2,5,3,1]?
solution

    Using slicing:

python

list1 = [2, 5, 3, 1]
reversed_list = list1[::-1]
print(reversed_list)

Both of these approaches will reverse the list list1, and the output will be:

csharp

[1, 3, 5, 2]

This output shows the reversed order of the elements in the list.


So, the output of the code will be:

5

It tells us that the value at index 4 of the list1 is 5.

5. What will be the output of below Python code?

list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
list1[0] = 10
print(list1)
 solution

The given Python code modifies a list called list1 and then prints its contents. 
Let's break down the code step by step:

    list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]: This line initializes a list named list1 with five
 elements [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

    list1[0] = 10: This line modifies the value at the first position (index 0) 
of list1. It sets the value at index 0 to 10. In Python, list indexing is zero-based, 
so list1[0] refers to the first element of the list.

After this line of code, the list list1 will be updated to [10, 2, 3, 4, 5] because
 we changed the value at index 0 from 1 to 10.

    print(list1): This line prints the contents of the modified list1 to the console.

So, the output of the code will be:

csharp

[10, 2, 3, 4, 5]

This output tells us that the value at index 0 of list1 has been changed from 1 to 10, 
and the list now contains [10, 2, 3, 4, 5].

LIST METHODS
1. What will be the output of below Python code?

list1 = [4, 4, 3, 1]
list1.pop(2)
print(list1)

2. The given Python code works with a list named list1, specifically removing an element
 using the pop() method. Let's break down the code step by step:

    list1 = [4, 4, 3, 1]: This line initializes a list called list1 with four elements [4, 4, 3, 1].

    list1.pop(2): This line uses the pop() method to remove an element from list1. The argument
 2 is the index of the element to be removed. In Python, list indexing is zero-based, so list1.pop(2) 
removes the element at index 2.

    After this operation, the element at index 2 (which is 3) is removed from list1, and list1
 is modified as [4, 4, 1].

    print(list1): This line prints the modified list1 to the console.

So, the output of the code will be:

csharp

[4, 4, 1]

This output shows the updated contents of list1 after removing the element at index 2.

3. What will be the output of following Python code?

list1=["Go","Java","C","Python"]
print(max(list1))

solution
The Python code you provided is attempting to find the maximum element in the list list1 
and then print it using the max() function. In this case, the elements in list1 are strings, 
and the max() function will find the maximum string based on lexicographic (dictionary) order.

Here's what happens:

    list1 is defined as ["Go", "Java", "C", "Python"], which is a list containing four strings.
    The max() function is called on list1.
    The max() function iterates through the elements in the list and returns the maximum element 
based on lexicographic order.

Now, let's determine the maximum element based on lexicographic order:

    "Go" comes before "Java" because 'G' comes before 'J' in the alphabet.
    "Java" comes before "C" because 'J' comes before 'C'.
    "Java" also comes before "Python" because 'J' comes before 'P'.

So, based on lexicographic order, "Python" is the maximum string in the list.

The output of the code will be:

Python

It will print "Python" to the console because that is the maximum element in the list when 
comparing the strings lexicographically.

4. What will be the output of below Python code?

num = [4, 4, 3, 1]
num.sort()
print(num)

 The Python code you provided is sorting a list of numbers (num) in ascending order
 using the sort() method and then printing the sorted list. Here's what happens step by step:

    num is defined as [4, 4, 3, 1], which is a list containing four integers.

    The sort() method is called on the num list. This method sorts the list in ascending order, 
meaning it arranges the elements from smallest to largest.

    After sorting, the num list becomes [1, 3, 4, 4].

    Finally, the print() function is used to print the sorted list, which is [1, 3, 4, 4].

So, the output of the code will be:

csharp

[1, 3, 4, 4]

It prints the sorted list of numbers in ascending order. Note that the original list is modified
 in place by the sort() method.

5. What will be the output of following Python code?

list1=["Go","Java","C","Rust"]
print(min(list1))

6. The Python code you provided is attempting to find the minimum element in the list 
list1 and then print it using the min() function. In this case, the elements in list1 
are strings, and the min() function will find the minimum string based on lexicographic
 (dictionary) order.

Here's what happens:

    list1 is defined as ["Go", "Java", "C", "Rust"], which is a list containing four strings.

    The min() function is called on list1.

    The min() function iterates through the elements in the list and returns the minimum 
element based on lexicographic order.

Now, let's determine the minimum element based on lexicographic order:

    "C" comes before "Go" because 'C' comes before 'G' in the alphabet.
    "C" also comes before "Java" because 'C' comes before 'J'.
    "C" also comes before "Rust" because 'C' comes before 'R'.

So, based on lexicographic order, "C" is the minimum string in the list.

The output of the code will be:

mathematica

C

It will print "C" to the console because that is the minimum element in the list when 
comparing the strings lexicographically.

7. What is the len(list1) for below value?

list1=['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']

The code len(list1) is used to find the length (i.e., the number of elements) of a list in Python.

In this specific case, the list list1 contains the elements ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']. 
Therefore, when you execute len(list1), it will return the number of elements in the list, which is 5.

So, the value of len(list1) for the given list is 5.

8. What will be the output of below Python code?

list1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
list1.append(60)
print(list1)

solution
The Python code you provided is modifying a list named list1 by adding an element to it using 
the append() method, and then it prints the modified list. Here's what happens step by step:

    list1 is initially defined as [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], which is a list containing five integers.

    The append() method is called on list1, and it is given the argument 60. This method adds the
 value 60 to the end of the list.

    After the append() operation, the list1 list becomes [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60].

    Finally, the print() function is used to print the modified list, which is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60].

So, the output of the code will be:

csharp

[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]

It prints the modified list1 with the additional element 60 at the end.

9. What will be the output of below Python code?

list1=['UK','India','Canada']

list1.insert(1,8)

print(list1)

10. The Python code you provided is attempting to insert an integer (8) into a list named 
list1 at a specific position (index 1) and then print the modified list. Here's what happens step by step:

    list1 is initially defined as ['UK', 'India', 'Canada'], which is a list containing three strings.

    The insert() method is called on list1. This method is used to insert an element at a specified
 position in the list. In this case, it's inserting the integer 8 at index 1.

    After the insert() operation, the list1 list becomes ['UK', 8, 'India', 'Canada']. The integer 8 
has been inserted at index 1, pushing the other elements to the right.

    Finally, the print() function is used to print the modified list, which is ['UK', 8, 'India', 'Canada'].

So, the output of the code will be:

css

['UK', 8, 'India', 'Canada']

It prints the modified list1 with the integer 8 inserted at index 1.

11. What will be the output of below Python code?

ages = [56, 72, 24, 46]
ages.sort()
print(ages)

The Python code you provided is sorting a list of integers ages in ascending 
order using the sort() method and then printing the sorted list. Here's what happens step by step:

    ages is defined as [56, 72, 24, 46], which is a list containing four integers.

    The sort() method is called on the ages list. This method sorts the list in 
ascending order, arranging the elements from smallest to largest.

    After sorting, the ages list becomes [24, 46, 56, 72].

    Finally, the print() function is used to print the sorted list, which is [24, 46, 56, 72].

So, the output of the code will be:

csharp

[24, 46, 56, 72]

It prints the sorted list of ages in ascending order. Note that the original list is
 modified in place by the sort() method.
