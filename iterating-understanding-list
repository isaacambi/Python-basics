TERATING LIST
1. How many asterisks will be printed when the following code executes?

for x in [0, 1, 1, 3]:
    for y in [0, 2, 1, 2]:
            print('*')
solution
The provided code contains nested loops, and it prints an asterisk
 ('*') in each iteration of the inner loop. The code consists of two loops:

    The outer loop iterates over the elements [0, 1, 1, 3] using the variable x.
    The inner loop iterates over the elements [0, 2, 1, 2] using the variable y.
    In each iteration of the inner loop, it prints a single asterisk ('*').

To determine how many asterisks will be printed, we need to multiply the 
number of iterations in the outer loop (x) by the number of iterations in 
the inner loop (y) and sum up the results for each combination of x and y.

Here's a breakdown of the iterations:

    When x is 0, the inner loop will iterate 4 times (for each value of y),
 so 4 asterisks will be printed.
    When x is 1, the inner loop will iterate 4 times again, resulting in 4
 more asterisks.
    When x is 1 again, the inner loop will iterate 4 more times, resulting in 
4 additional asterisks.
    When x is 3, the inner loop will iterate 4 times once more, resulting in 4
 more asterisks.

Now, sum up the asterisks from each iteration of x:

4 (when x = 0) + 4 (when x = 1) + 4 (when x = 1) + 4 (when x = 3) = 16

So, a total of 16 asterisks will be printed when this code executes.

2. Which of the following statements won’t be printed when this Python code is run?

for letter in 'KodeKloud':
    if letter == 'u':
        continue
    print('Letter : ' + letter)

The provided Python code iterates over the characters in the string 
'KodeKloud' using a for loop and prints each character unless the character
 is equal to 'u'. In that case, it uses the continue statement to skip printing
 the character. Here's a breakdown of the code:

    The for loop iterates over each character in the string 'KodeKloud' one by one.

    In each iteration, it checks if the current character (letter) is equal to 'u'.

    If letter is equal to 'u', the continue statement is executed, which means
 the print() statement below it is skipped for that iteration.

    If letter is not equal to 'u', it executes the print() statement, which prints 
the character along with the string 'Letter : '.

Now, let's analyze which characters will not be printed:

    'K' will be printed.
    'o' will be printed.
    'd' will be printed.
    'e' will be printed.
    'K' will be printed.
    'l' will be printed.
    'o' will be printed.
    'o' will be printed.
    'd' will be printed.

The character 'u' is the only one that won't be printed because of the
 if letter == 'u': continue condition.

So, the statement that won't be printed is:

yaml

Letter : u

It will be skipped due to the continue statement when letter is equal to 'u'.

3. for i in [1, 1, 7, 0, 6]:, how many times a loop run ? 
The code you provided contains a for loop that iterates over a
 list [1, 1, 7, 0, 6]. The loop will run as many times as there are 
elements in the list, so it will run 5 times. Here's the breakdown of the iterations:

    In the first iteration, i will be assigned the value 1.

    In the second iteration, i will again be assigned the value 1.

    In the third iteration, i will be assigned the value 7.

    In the fourth iteration, i will be assigned the value 0.

    In the fifth iteration, i will be assigned the value 6.

4. Which of the following statements won’t be printed when this Python code is run?

for letter in 'KodeKloud':
    if letter == 'e':
        continue
    print('Letter : ' + letter)
solution
The provided Python code iterates over the characters in the string 'KodeKloud' 
using a for loop and prints each character unless the character is equal to 'e'. 
In that case, it uses the continue statement to skip printing the character. 
Here's a breakdown of the code:

    The for loop iterates over each character in the string 'KodeKloud' one by one.

    In each iteration, it checks if the current character (letter) is equal to 'e'.

    If letter is equal to 'e', the continue statement is executed, 
which means the print() statement below it is skipped for that iteration.

    If letter is not equal to 'e', it executes the print() statement, which 
prints the character along with the string 'Letter : '.

Now, let's analyze which characters won't be printed:

    'K' will be printed.
    'o' will be printed.
    'd' will be printed.

The character 'e' is the only one that won't be printed because of the if letter == 'e':
 continue condition.

So, the statement that won't be printed is:

yaml

Letter : e

It will be skipped due to the continue statement when letter is equal to 'e'.


So, the loop will run 5 times, once for each element in the list [1, 1, 7, 0, 6].

5. for i in [9, 1, 5, 6]:, how many times a loop runs ?
Ans = 4

6. How many asterisks will be printed when the following code executes?

for x in [0, 2, 1, 3]:
    for y in [0, 4, 1, 2]:
            print('*')

Ans = 16

7. What will be printed by the following code when it executes?

sum = 0
values = [2,9,1,7]
for number in values:
    sum += number

print(sum)

solution
The provided Python code calculates the sum of the numbers in the 
values list and then prints the result. Here's what the code does step by step:

    sum is initialized to 0. This variable will be used to store the 
running sum of the numbers in the values list.

    values is defined as [2, 9, 1, 7], which is a list containing four integers.

    The code enters a for loop that iterates through each element in the values list.

    In each iteration, the current element (number) is added to the sum using 
the += operator. This accumulates the sum of the numbers.
        First iteration: sum becomes 0 + 2 = 2
        Second iteration: sum becomes 2 + 9 = 11
        Third iteration: sum becomes 11 + 1 = 12
        Fourth iteration: sum becomes 12 + 7 = 19

    After all iterations are complete, the print() statement is used to print
 the value of sum, which is 19.

So, when you execute the code, it will print:

19

This is the sum of all the numbers in the values list.

UNDERSTANDING LIST
1. What will be the output of below Python code?

letters = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E"]
print(letters[1:])
 solution

The provided Python code creates a list called letters containing
 five elements ("A", "B", "C", "D", "E"), and then it prints a portion of the 
list using slicing.

In Python, list slicing allows you to extract a portion of a list by specifying a
 starting index (inclusive) and an ending index (exclusive). In your code, letters[1:] 
means "start from index 1 (inclusive) and go to the end of the list."

Here's what happens:

    letters is defined as ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E"], which is a list containing five strings.

    The print() function is used to print a portion of the list letters using slicing.

    letters[1:] slices the list starting from index 1 (which is "B") and 
includes all elements until the end of the list. So, it includes "B", "C", "D", and "E".

The output of the code will be:

css

['B', 'C', 'D', 'E']

It prints a new list containing the elements from "B" to the end of the original
 list, as specified by the slicing operation.

2. What will be the output of below Python code?

list1 = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
print(list1[::1])
solution

The provided Python code prints a portion of the list list1 using
 list slicing with a step of 1. Here's what happens:

    list1 is defined as [10, 11, 12, 13, 14], which is a list containing five integers.

    The print() function is used to print a portion of the list list1 using
 slicing with the following syntax: list1[::1].

In list slicing, the :: notation allows you to specify three values: start, stop, and step. 
In this case:

    start is empty, so it defaults to the beginning of the list.
    stop is also empty, so it defaults to the end of the list.
    step is 1, which means it will include every element with a step of 1.

So, the code essentially slices the entire list, including all elements, without
 skipping any. It's equivalent to just printing the entire list list1.

The output of the code will be:

csharp

[10, 11, 12, 13, 14]

It prints the entire original list list1.

3. What will be the output of below Python code?

list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
for index, j in enumerate(list1):
     print(index, j)
solution

The provided Python code uses a for loop and the enumerate() function
 to iterate over the elements of the list list1 and print both the index 
and the corresponding element. Here's what happens:

    list1 is defined as [1, 2, 3, 4], which is a list containing four integers.

    The for loop is used to iterate over the elements of list1. The enumerate()
 function is used to provide both the index and the element in each iteration.

    In the first iteration, index will be 0, and j will be 1. The print() statement
 will print 0 1.

    In the second iteration, index will be 1, and j will be 2. The print() 
statement will print 1 2.

    In the third iteration, index will be 2, and j will be 3. The print() 
statement will print 2 3.

    In the fourth and final iteration, index will be 3, and j will be 4. 
The print() statement will print 3 4.

So, the output of the code will be:

0 1
1 2
2 3
3 4

It prints the index and element pair for each element in the list1, with 
the index starting from 0 and incrementing by 1 for each iteration.

4. list1 = [[1,2,3,2,5],[4,5,6,7],[8,9,10]]
for i in list1:
      if len(i)==4:
        print(i)

The provided Python code iterates over the elements of the list1, 
which is a list of lists, and checks if the length of each inner list
 is equal to 4. If the length is 4, it prints the inner list. Here's what happens:

    list1 is defined as [[1, 2, 3, 2, 5], [4, 5, 6, 7], [8, 9, 10]], which 
is a list containing three inner lists.

    The for loop iterates over each inner list in list1.

    In the first iteration, i is [1, 2, 3, 2, 5]. The code checks the length
 of i, which is 5 (it has 5 elements), so it doesn't meet the condition of
 having a length of 4, and nothing is printed for this inner list.

    In the second iteration, i is [4, 5, 6, 7]. The code checks the length
 of i, which is 4, and this inner list meets the condition. Therefore, it
 prints this inner list.

    In the third iteration, i is [8, 9, 10]. The code checks the length of i, 
which is 3 (it has 3 elements), so it doesn't meet the condition of having a 
length of 4, and nothing is printed for this inner list.

So, the output of the code will be:

csharp

[4, 5, 6, 7]

It prints the inner list [4, 5, 6, 7] because it's the only inner list in list1
 that has a length of 4.

5. What will be the output of below Python code?

list1 = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
print(list1[0])

6. What will be the output of below Python code?

list1 = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
print(list1[0])

Ans = 10

7. What will be the output of below Python code?

list1=[4,0,7,1]
print(list1[::-1])
 solution

The Python code you provided is printing the reverse of the list list1
 using list slicing with a step of -1. Here's what happens:

    list1 is defined as [4, 0, 7, 1], which is a list containing four integers.

    The print() function is used to print a portion of the list list1 using 
slicing with the syntax list1[::-1].

In list slicing, the [::-1] notation is used to reverse a list. It means
 "start from the end of the list (-1 index), go to the beginning of the list
 (None), and move with a step of -1 (i.e., reverse the order of elements)."

So, the code effectively reverses the list and prints it in reverse order.

The output of the code will be:

csharp

[1, 7, 0, 4]

It prints the reversed version of the original list1.

8. What will be the output of below Python code?

list1 = [[1,2,3,2,5],[4,5,6,7],[8,9,10]]
for i in list1:
      if len(i)==3:
        print(i)
Ans = 8,9,10

9. What will be the output of below Python code?

list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
for i, j in enumerate(list1):
     print(i, j)

solution
0 1
1 2
2 3
3 4

10. What will be the output of below Python code?

list1 = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
list1.append(15)
print(list1)

Ans = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
