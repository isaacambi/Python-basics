LE LOOP
1. What keyword would you use to add an alternative condition to an if statement?
solution
elif

2. What does the following Python program display?
x = 1
while ( x < 20 ):
 x = x * 2
print(x)
solution
x = 1: Initializes a variable x with the value 1.

while (x < 20):: This is a while loop. It checks if the value of x is less than 20. 
As x is initially 1, this condition is true, so the code inside the loop will execute.

Inside the loop, there is a single statement:

makefile

    x = x * 2

    This statement multiplies the current value of x by 2 and 
assigns the result back to x. In the first iteration of the loop, x 
is doubled from 1 to 2.

    After executing the statement inside the loop, the program goes
 back to the while condition and checks it again. As long as x is less
 than 20, the loop will continue to execute.

    In the second iteration of the loop, x is now 2, and the 
statement x = x * 2 multiplies it by 2 again, making x equal to 4.

    The loop continues to iterate, doubling the value of x in each iteration. 
Here's how x changes in each iteration:
        Iteration 1: x is 2.
        Iteration 2: x is 4.
        Iteration 3: x is 8.
        Iteration 4: x is 16.

    In the fifth iteration, x is 16, and when we execute x = x * 2, 
it becomes 32. At this point, x is no longer less than 20, so the while 
loop condition (x < 20) becomes false.

    The loop terminates because the condition is false, and the program
 proceeds to the next statement after the loop.

    Finally, print(x) is executed, which prints the value of x. In this
 case, x is 32, so it will print "32" to the console.

So, the code essentially doubles the value of x in each iteration of the
 loop until x becomes greater than or equal to 20, and the final value of x is 32.

3. What is the output when this code executes?
x = 1
while ( x <= 5 ):
  x += 1
print(x)

x = 1: Initializes a variable x with the value 1.

while (x <= 5):: This is a while loop. It checks if the value of x is
 less than or equal to 5. Since x is initially 1,
 which is less than 5, this condition is true, so the code inside the 
loop will execute.

Inside the loop, there is a single statement:

makefile

x += 1

This statement is shorthand for incrementing x by 1. In other words, 
it adds 1 to the current value of x. 
So, in the first iteration of the loop, x is incremented from 1 to 2.

After executing the statement inside the loop, the program goes back to
 the while condition and checks it again. As long as x is less than or 
equal to 5, the loop will continue to execute.

In the second iteration of the loop, x is now 2, and x += 1 increments it to 3.

The loop continues to iterate, incrementing x by 1 in each iteration:

    Iteration 1: x is 2.
    Iteration 2: x is 3.
    Iteration 3: x is 4.
    Iteration 4: x is 5.
    Iteration 5: x is 6.

In the sixth iteration, x is 6, and when we execute the statement x += 1, 
it becomes 7. At this point, x is no longer less than or equal to 5, so the
 while loop condition (x <= 5) becomes false.

The loop terminates because the condition is false, and the program proceeds
 to the next statement after the loop.

Finally, print(x) is executed, which prints the value of x. In this case, x is 7,
 so it will print "7" to the console.

So, the code increments the value of x by 1 in each iteration of the loop until
 x becomes greater than 5, and the final value of x is 7.

4. What will be the output of the following Python code?
i = 2
while True:
    if i%3 == 0:
        break
    print(i)
    i += 2
solution
i = 2: Initializes a variable i with the value 2.

while True:: This is an infinite while loop. The loop will continue to execute as 
long as the condition True remains true. Since True is always true, this loop will 
continue indefinitely until it is explicitly terminated with a break statement.

Inside the loop, there is an if statement:

kotlin

if i % 3 == 0:
    break

a. i % 3 == 0: This condition checks if the remainder of dividing the current value 
of i by 3 is equal to 0. In other words, it checks if i is divisible by 3 without a remainder.

b. break: If the condition is true (i.e., i is divisible by 3 without a remainder), 
the break statement is executed. The break statement immediately terminates the loop and exits it.

If the condition i % 3 == 0 is false, meaning i is not divisible by 3 without a remainder, 
the code inside the if block is skipped, and the following lines are executed:

css

    print(i)
    i += 2

    a. print(i): This line prints the current value of i. 
In the first iteration, i is 2, so it prints "2" to the console.

    b. i += 2: This line increments the value of i by 2.
 After the increment, i becomes 4 in the first iteration.

    After executing the lines inside the loop, the program goes 
back to the beginning of the loop (while True:) and checks the condition again. 
This process continues indefinitely.

    In each iteration, the value of i is incremented by 2 and printed, 
but the loop will terminate when i becomes divisible by 3 without a remainder.

Here's how the code behaves in each iteration:

    Iteration 1: i is 2 (not divisible by 3 without remainder), prints "2," increments to 4.
    Iteration 2: i is 4 (not divisible by 3 without remainder), prints "4," increments to 6.
    Termination: In the third iteration, i is 6, which is divisible by 3 without a remainder. 
Therefore, the break statement is executed, and the loop terminates.

So, the code prints "2" and "4" to the console and stops when i becomes divisible by 3 
(in this case, when i reaches 6).

5. What is the value of x â€¦
x = 0
while (x < 50):
  x+=2

print(x)
 solution
x = 0: Initializes a variable x with the value 0.

while (x < 50):: This is a while loop. It checks if the value of x is less than 50. 
As x is initially 0, which is less than 50, this condition is true, so the code inside the loop will execute.

Inside the loop, there is a single statement:

makefile

    x += 2

    This statement is shorthand for incrementing x by 2. In other words, 
it adds 2 to the current value of x. So, in each iteration of the loop, 
x is incremented by 2.

    After executing the x += 2 statement inside the loop, the program goes
 back to the while condition and checks it again. As long as x remains less 
than 50, the loop will continue to execute.

    The loop continues to iterate, incrementing x by 2 in each iteration.
 Here's how x changes in each iteration:
        Iteration 1: x is incremented from 0 to 2.
        Iteration 2: x is incremented from 2 to 4.
        Iteration 3: x is incremented from 4 to 6.
        ...

    This process continues until x becomes equal to or greater than 50.

    When x reaches a value of 50 or greater, the while loop condition x < 50 becomes false.

    The loop terminates because the condition is false, and the program 
proceeds to the next statement after the loop.

    Finally, print(x) is executed, which prints the value of x. In this case,
 x will be the last value it had before the loop terminated, which is the first 
value greater than or equal to 50. So, it will print that value.

The loop essentially increments x by 2 in each iteration until x becomes 50 or
 greater, and then it prints the final value of x.
Ans = 50

6. What will be the output of the following Python code?
i = 1
while True:
    if i % 0o7 == 0:
        break
    print(i)
    i += 1
his code uses a while loop to increment a variable i and print its value in each iteration
 until i becomes divisible by 7 (in base 8, also known as octal representation). Here's a
 step-by-step explanation of the code:

    i = 1: Initializes a variable i with the value 1.

    while True:: This is an infinite while loop because the condition True is always true,
 meaning the loop will continue executing indefinitely until it is explicitly terminated with a break statement.

    Inside the loop, there is an if statement:

    kotlin

if i % 0o7 == 0:
    break

a. i % 0o7: This calculates the remainder when i is divided by 7 in base 8 (octal). 
In octal representation, 0o7 is equivalent to decimal 7. So, i % 7 checks if i is divisible
 by 7 without a remainder.

b. break: If the condition is true (i.e., if i is divisible by 7 without a remainder), the 
break statement is executed. This immediately terminates the loop and exits it.

If the condition i % 0o7 == 0 is false, meaning i is not divisible by 7 without a remainder, 
the code inside the if block is skipped, and the following lines are executed:

css

    print(i)
    i += 1

    a. print(i): This line prints the current value of i. In the first 
iteration, i is 1, so it prints "1" to the console.

    b. i += 1: This line increments the value of i by 1, so in each iteration, 
i is increased by 1.

    After executing the lines inside the loop, the program goes back to the 
beginning of the loop (while True:) and checks
 the condition again. This process continues indefinitely.

    In each iteration, the value of i is incremented by 1 and printed, but the
 loop will terminate when i becomes divisible by 7 (in base 8).

Here's how the code behaves in each iteration:

    Iteration 1: i is 1 (not divisible by 7 in base 8), prints "1," increments to 2.
    Iteration 2: i is 2 (not divisible by 7 in base 8), prints "2," increments to 3.
    Iteration 3: i is 3 (not divisible by 7 in base 8), prints "3," increments to 4.
    Iteration 4: i is 4 (not divisible by 7 in base 8), prints "4," increments to 5.
    Iteration 5: i is 5 (not divisible by 7 in base 8), prints "5," increments to 6.
    Iteration 6: i is 6 (not divisible by 7 in base 8), prints "6," increments to 7.

    In the seventh iteration, i is 7 (divisible by 7 in base 8), so the 
condition i % 0o7 == 0 becomes true, and the break statement is executed.

    The loop terminates because the condition is true, and the program proceeds
 to the next statement after the loop.

So, the code prints "1" through "6" to the console and stops when i becomes 
divisible by 7 in base 8 (in this case, when i reaches 7).

7. What will be the output of the following Python code?
i = 5
while True:
    if i % 0o11 == 0:
        break
    print(i)
    i += 1

8. i = 5: Initializes a variable i with the value 5.

while True:: This is an infinite while loop because the condition True is always true, 
meaning the loop will continue executing indefinitely until it is explicitly terminated with a break statement.

Inside the loop, there is an if statement:

kotlin

if i % 0o11 == 0:
    break

a. i % 0o11: This calculates the remainder when i is divided by 11 in base 8 (octal). 
In octal representation, 0o11 is equivalent to decimal 9. So, i % 9 checks if i is divisible
 by 9 without a remainder.

b. break: If the condition is true (i.e., if i is divisible by 9 without a remainder), the break
 statement is executed. This immediately terminates the loop and exits it.

If the condition i % 0o11 == 0 is false, meaning i is not divisible by 11 without a remainder, 
the code inside the if block is skipped, and the following lines are executed:

css

    print(i)
    i += 1

    a. print(i): This line prints the current value of i. In the first iteration, i is 5,
 so it prints "5" to the console.

    b. i += 1: This line increments the value of i by 1, so in each iteration, i is increased by 1.

    After executing the lines inside the loop, the program goes back to the beginning of the loop
 (while True:) and checks the condition again. This process continues indefinitely.

    In each iteration, the value of i is incremented by 1 and printed, but the loop will terminate
 when i becomes divisible by 11 (in base 8).

Here's how the code behaves in each iteration:

    Iteration 1: i is 5 (not divisible by 11 in base 8), prints "5," increments to 6.
    Iteration 2: i is 6 (not divisible by 11 in base 8), prints "6," increments to 7.
    Iteration 3: i is 7 (not divisible by 11 in base 8), prints "7," increments to 8.
    Iteration 4: i is 8 (not divisible by 11 in base 8), prints "8," increments to 9.

    In the fifth iteration, i is 9 (divisible by 11 in base 8), so the condition i % 0o11 == 0 
becomes true, and the break statement is executed.

    The loop terminates because the condition is true, and the program proceeds to the next statement 
after the loop.

So, the code prints "5" through "8" to the console and stops when i becomes divisible by 11 in base 8
 (in this case, when i reaches 9).

9. What does the following code produce as output?
i = 1
x = 3
sum = 0
while ( i <= x ):
 sum += i
 i += 1
print(sum)

solution
certainly! Let's break down this code step by step and explain what each part does:

    i = 1: Initializes a variable i with the value 1.

    x = 3: Initializes a variable x with the value 3.

    sum = 0: Initializes a variable sum with the value 0. 
This variable will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers.

    while (i <= x):: This is a while loop. It checks if the 
value of i is less than or equal to the value of x. In this case,
 i is initially 1, and x is 3, so the condition is true, and the code 
inside the loop will execute.

    Inside the loop, there are two statements:

    a. sum += i: This statement adds the current value of i to the sum
 variable. It accumulates the sum of numbers as the loop iterates. In the 
first iteration, i is 1, so sum becomes 0 + 1, which is 1.

    b. i += 1: This statement increments the value of i by 1 in each 
iteration, so i is increased by 1. After the first iteration, i becomes 2.

    The loop continues to iterate as long as the condition i <= x is true. 
In this case, it will iterate three times because i starts at 1, and x is 3.

    In the second iteration, i is 2, and sum += i adds 2 to the current sum, 
making sum equal to 3.

    In the third and final iteration, i is 3, and sum += i adds 3 to the
 current sum, making sum equal to 6.

    After the third iteration, the condition i <= x is no longer true because 
i is now 4, which is not less than or equal to 3. Therefore, the loop terminates.

    Finally, print(sum) is executed, which prints the value of the sum variable.
 In this case, sum is 6, so it will print "6" to the console.

So, the code calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 3 and prints the result, 
which is 6, to the console

10. i = 1
while True:
    if i%3 == 0:
        break
    print(i)
    i += 1
solution
i = 1: Initializes a variable i with the value 1.

while True:: This is an infinite while loop because the condition True is always true. 
This means that the loop will continue executing indefinitely until it is explicitly
 terminated with a break statement.

Inside the loop, there is an if statement:

kotlin

if i % 3 == 0:
    break

a. i % 3 == 0: This condition checks if the remainder of dividing the current value 
of i by 3 is equal to 0. In other words, it checks if i is divisible by 3 without a remainder.

b. break: If the condition is true (i.e., if i is divisible by 3 without a remainder),
 the break statement is executed. This immediately terminates the loop and exits it.

If the condition i % 3 == 0 is false, meaning i is not divisible by 3 without a remainder,
 the code inside the if block is skipped, and the following lines are executed:

css

    print(i)
    i += 1

    a. print(i): This line prints the current value of i. In the first 
iteration, i is 1, so it prints "1" to the console.

    b. i += 1: This line increments the value of i by 1. In each iteration, 
i is increased by 1.

    After executing the lines inside the loop, the program goes back to the 
beginning of the loop (while True:) and checks the 
condition again. This process continues indefinitely.

    In each iteration, the value of i is incremented by 1 and printed, but
 the loop will terminate when i becomes divisible by 3 without a remainder.

Here's how the code behaves in each iteration:

    Iteration 1: i is 1 (not divisible by 3 without remainder), prints "1," 
increments to 2.
    Iteration 2: i is 2 (not divisible by 3 without remainder), prints "2,"
 increments to 3.

    In the third iteration, i is 3, and when we execute i % 3 == 0, it becomes
 true because 3 is divisible by 3 without a remainder.

    The break statement is executed, which immediately terminates the loop and 
exits it.

So, the code prints "1" and "2" to the console and stops when i becomes divisible
 by 3 without a remainder (in this case, when i reaches 3).
