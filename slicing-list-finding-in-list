LICING LISTS
1. What will be the output of below Python code?

my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
print(my_list[-1])

solution
The provided Python code is accessing and printing the last element 
of the list my_list. Here's what happens:

    my_list is defined as [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], which is a list containing five integers.

    The code uses the index -1 to access the last element of the list.
 In Python, negative indices count from the end of the list, so -1 refers to the last element.

    The print() function is used to print the value of the last element, which is 4.

So, the output of the code will be:

4

It prints the value of the last element in the list my_list, which is 4.

2. What will be the output of below Python code?

my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
my_list.append("python")
b = my_list[1:]
print(b)
solution
The provided Python code does the following:

    my_list is initially defined as [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], which is a
 list containing five integers.

    The append() method is used to add the string "python" to the end 
of my_list, so my_list becomes [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, "python"].

    The variable b is assigned a new list created by slicing my_list 
from index 1 onwards (my_list[1:]). This slice includes all elements 
of my_list starting from the element at index 1 (inclusive), which is 1, 
to the end of the list.

    Finally, the print() function is used to print the contents of b.

The output of the code will be:

css

[1, 2, 3, 4, 'python']

It prints the elements of b, which is a new list containing all elements
 of my_list starting from index 1 (inclusive) onward. So, it includes [1, 2, 3, 4, 'python'].

3. What will be the output of below Python code?

list1 = [1, 66, "python", [11, 55, "cat"], [ ], 2.22, True]
print(list1[2:4])
 solution
The provided Python code is using list slicing to extract a sublist
 from list1 that includes elements at index 2 up to (but not including) 
index 4. Here's what happens:

    list1 is defined as [1, 66, "python", [11, 55, "cat"], [ ], 2.22, True],
 which is a list containing various types of elements, including integers, 
strings, lists, floats, and a boolean.

    The code uses list slicing with list1[2:4]. This notation means "start
 from index 2 (inclusive) and go up to index 4 (exclusive)."

    The elements at index 2 and 3 are included in the slice. So, it includes
 "python" at index 2 and [11, 55, "cat"] at index 3.

    The print() function is used to print the extracted sublist.

The output of the code will be:

css

['python', [11, 55, 'cat']]

It prints a new list containing the elements "python" (at index 2)
 and [11, 55, "cat"] (at index 3), which are the elements that fall 
within the specified slice range.

4. What will be the output of below Python code?

my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
print(my_list[::3])
 The provided Python code is using list slicing with a step 
value of 3 to extract elements from my_list. Here's what happens:

    my_list is defined as [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], which is a list containing 
five integers.

    The code uses list slicing with the notation my_list[::3]. In list 
slicing, the :: notation allows you to specify three values: start, stop, and step. 
In this case:
        start is empty, so it defaults to the beginning of the list.
        stop is also empty, so it defaults to the end of the list.
        step is 3, which means it will include every third element in the list.

    The code extracts elements from my_list with a step of 3, meaning it includes
 every third element. It starts from the beginning (index 0) and includes elements 
at indices 0, 3, and 4.

    The print() function is used to print the extracted elements.

The output of the code will be:

csharp

[0, 3]

It prints a new list containing the elements [0, 3], which are the elements 
from my_list that fall within the specified slicing criteria (every third element).

5. What will be the output of below Python code?

list1 = [1, 66, "python", [11, 55, "cat"], [ ], 2.22, True]
print(list1[0:4])

6. The provided Python code is using list slicing to extract a sublist
 from list1 that includes elements at indices 0 up to (but not including) index 4. Here's what happens:

    list1 is defined as [1, 66, "python", [11, 55, "cat"], [ ], 2.22, True], 
which is a list containing various types of elements, including integers, strings,
 lists, floats, and a boolean.

    The code uses list slicing with list1[0:4]. This notation means "start from 
index 0 (inclusive) and go up to index 4 (exclusive)."

    The elements at indices 0, 1, 2, and 3 are included in the slice. So, 
it includes 1, 66, "python", and [11, 55, "cat"].

    The print() function is used to print the extracted sublist.

The output of the code will be:

css

[1, 66, 'python', [11, 55, 'cat']]

It prints a new list containing the elements at indices 0, 1, 2, and 3 from list1,
 which are [1, 66, "python", [11, 55, "cat"]].

7. What will be the output of below Python code?

my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
print(my_list[::2])
 
solution

The provided Python code is using list slicing with a step value of 2
 to extract elements from my_list. Here's what happens:

    my_list is defined as [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], which is a list containing five integers.

    The code uses list slicing with the notation my_list[::2]. In list slicing, 
the :: notation allows you to specify three values: start, stop, and step. In this case:
        start is empty, so it defaults to the beginning of the list.
        stop is also empty, so it defaults to the end of the list.
        step is 2, which means it will include every second element in the list.

    The code extracts elements from my_list with a step of 2, meaning it includes
 every second element. It starts from the beginning (index 0) and includes elements 
at indices 0, 2, and 4.

    The print() function is used to print the extracted elements.

The output of the code will be:

csharp

[0, 2, 4]

It prints a new list containing the elements [0, 2, 4], which are the elements
 from my_list that fall within the specified slicing criteria (every second element).

8. What will be the output of below Python code?

my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
print(my_list[2:4])
 solution
The provided Python code is using list slicing to extract a sublist from 
my_list that includes elements at indices 2 up to (but not including) index 4. 
Here's what happens:

    my_list is defined as [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], which is a list containing five integers.

    The code uses list slicing with the notation my_list[2:4]. This notation means 
"start from index 2 (inclusive) and go up to index 4 (exclusive)."

    The elements at indices 2 and 3 are included in the slice. So, it includes 2 and 3.

    The print() function is used to print the extracted sublist.

The output of the code will be:

csharp

[2, 3]

It prints a new list containing the elements at indices 2 and 3 from my_list, which are [2, 3].

9. What will be the output of below Python code?

list1 = [1, 66, "python", [11, 55, "cat"], [ ], 2.22, True]
print(list1.upper())

solution
The provided Python code attempts to call the upper() method on the list list1. 
However, this code will result in an error because the upper() 
method is a string method, and you cannot directly apply it to a list.

Here's an explanation of the error and what's happening:

    list1 is defined as [1, 66, "python", [11, 55, "cat"], [ ], 2.22, True],
 which is a list containing various types of elements.

    The code tries to call upper() on list1, but lists do not have an upper() 
method. The upper() method is used for strings to convert all characters to uppercase.

    Since you cannot use the upper() method on a list, Python will raise an
 AttributeError, indicating that the method does not exist for the list type

10. What will be the output of below Python code?

my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
my_list.append("python")
print(my_list[2:])
solution
The provided Python code does the following:

    my_list is initially defined as [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], which is a list containing five integers.

    The append() method is used to add the string "python" to the end of my_list. 
After this, my_list becomes [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, "python"].

    The code uses list slicing with my_list[2:]. This notation means "start from
 index 2 (inclusive) and include all elements up to the end of the list."

    The print() function is used to print the sublist that results from the slicing.

The output of the code will be:

css

[2, 3, 4, 'python']

It prints a new list containing the elements from my_list starting from index 2 
(inclusive) to the end of the list. So, it includes [2, 3, 4, "python"].

11. What will be the output of below Python code?

my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
print(my_list[::-1])
 
Ans = [4, 3, 2, 1, 0]

FINDING IN LIST
1. Choose the correct answer if the following list contains the element ‘A’.
 Check if you get “True” in the output.

Li = ['A','C','b', 1, 3, 4]

solution
The provided Python code checks if the list Li contains the element 'A' 
and prints either True or False based on the result of this check. Here's what happens:

    Li is defined as ['A', 'C', 'b', 1, 3, 4], which is a list containing a mix of
 elements including strings, integers, and lowercase letters.

    The code uses the in operator to check if 'A' is in the list Li. The in operator
 checks for the presence of an element in a list or other iterable.

    If 'A' is in the list, it will print True; otherwise, it will print False.

In this case, 'A' is indeed in the list Li, so the code will print True.

The output of the code will be:

graphql

True

It indicates that the element 'A' is present in the list Li.

2. What will be the output of the following Python code?

list1 = [0, 3, 4, 1, 2]
list1[2:4]=[1,2]
print(list1)
solution
The provided Python code modifies the elements of list1 using list slicing
 and assignment. Here's what happens step by step:

    list1 is defined as [0, 3, 4, 1, 2], which is a list containing five integers.

    The code uses list slicing to select a portion of list1 with indices 2 to 3 
(inclusive) on the left side of the assignment (list1[2:4]).

    It then assigns a new list [1, 2] to this selected portion of list1.

    After this assignment, the selected portion [4, 1] is replaced with [1, 2],
 effectively modifying the original list.

    Finally, the print() function is used to print the modified list1.

The output of the code will be:

csharp

[0, 3, 1, 2, 2]

The elements at indices 2 and 3 (4 and 1) have been replaced with [1, 2],
 resulting in the modified list [0, 3, 1, 2, 2].

3. What will be the output of the following Python code?

list1 = [0, 3, 4, 1, 2]
list1[1]=[8,9]
print(list1)
The provided Python code attempts to assign a new value [8, 9] to 
the element at index 1 in list1. Here's what happens:

    list1 is defined as [0, 3, 4, 1, 2], which is a list containing five integers.

    The code tries to assign the value [8, 9] to list1[1]. This means it's 
attempting to replace the element at index 1 (3) with the new value [8, 9].

    After this assignment, the element at index 1 (3) is replaced with the 
list [8, 9], effectively modifying the original list.

    Finally, the print() function is used to print the modified list1.

The output of the code will be:

csharp

[0, [8, 9], 4, 1, 2]

The element at index 1 (3) has been replaced with the list [8, 9], resulting 
in the modified list [0, [8, 9], 4, 1, 2].

4. What is the output of the following code:

(4, 6) not in [(4, 7), (5, 6), "hello"]

solution
The provided Python code checks if the tuple (4, 6) is not present
 in the list [(4, 7), (5, 6), "hello"]. Here's what happens:

    The code uses the not in operator to check if the tuple (4, 6) is
 not in the list [(4, 7), (5, 6), "hello"].

    It checks each element in the list for equality with (4, 6).

    (4, 6) is indeed not present in the list because there is no exact match. 
The closest match is (5, 6) which is a different tuple.

    Since (4, 6) is not in the list, the expression evaluates to True.

So, the output of the code will be:

graphql

True

It indicates that the tuple (4, 6) is not present in the 
list [(4, 7), (5, 6), "hello"].

5. What is the output of the following code:

(4, 6) not in [(4, 7), (5, 6), "hello"]

 
The provided Python code checks if the tuple (4, 6) is not present 
in the list [(4, 7), (5, 6), "hello"]. Here's what happens:

    The code uses the not in operator to check if the tuple (4, 6) is not
 in the list [(4, 7), (5, 6), "hello"].

    It checks each element in the list for equality with (4, 6).

    (4, 6) is indeed not present in the list because there is no exact match. 
The closest match is (5, 6) which is a different tuple.

    Since (4, 6) is not in the list, the expression evaluates to True.

So, the output of the code will be:

graphql

True

It indicates that the tuple (4, 6) is not present in the list [(4, 7), (5, 6), "hello"].

4. What will be the output of below Python code?

countries = ["USA", "Canada", "India"]
countries[0], countries[1] = countries[1], countries[0]
print(countries)

5. The provided Python code swaps the positions of the first two elements in the countries list using tuple unpacking. Here's what happens step by step:

    countries is defined as ["USA", "Canada", "India"], which is a list 
containing three strings.

    The code uses tuple unpacking to swap the values at indices 0 and 1 in the list. 
This is achieved with the following line of code:

    python

    countries[0], countries[1] = countries[1], countries[0]

    In this line, a temporary tuple (countries[1], countries[0]) is created. 
This tuple contains the values "Canada" and "USA" in that order. Then, using 
tuple unpacking, the values are assigned back to the list, effectively swapping 
the positions of the first two elements.

    After this operation, the list countries is modified. It now becomes
 ["Canada", "USA", "India"], with "Canada" at index 0 and "USA" at index 1.

    Finally, the print() function is used to print the modified countries list.

The output of the code will be:

css

['Canada', 'USA', 'India']

It shows that the positions of the first two elements have been swapped in the countries list.

6. What will be the output of below Python code?

my_list = [0, 3, 4, 1, 2]
print(my_list.index(1))
solution

The provided Python code uses the index() method to find the index 
of the first occurrence of the value 1 in the list my_list. Here's what happens:

    my_list is defined as [0, 3, 4, 1, 2], which is a list containing five integers.

    The index() method is called on my_list with the argument 1. This
 method searches for the first occurrence of the value 1 in the list.

    The index() method returns the index of the first occurrence of 1 in my_list.
 In this case, 1 is found at index 3 (remember that Python uses 0-based indexing, 
so the indices start from 0).

    The print() function is used to print the index value returned by the index() method.

The output of the code will be:

3

It indicates that the value 1 is found at index 3 in the my_list.

7. What will be the output of the following Python code?

list1=[3,4,6,1,2]
list2=list1
list1[0]=9
print(list2)

Ans = [9, 4, 6, 1, 2]

8. What will be the output of the following Python code?

list1 = [0, 3, 4, 1, 2]
list1[2:5]=[8,9]
print(list1)

Ans = [0, 3, 8, 9]

9. What will be the output of the following Python code?

list1=[3,4,6,1,2]
list2=list1
list1[1]=9
print(list2)

Ans = [3, 9, 6, 1, 2]

10. What will be the output of below Python code?

my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
print(my_list.index(2))

Ans = 2

11.
