GIC AND BIT OPERATIONS
1. What will be the output of the following Python code?is_hungry = False
if(not is_hungry):
  print("You are not hungry")
else:
  print("You are hungry")

This code is a simple Python program that uses a conditional statement
 (an if statement) to check whether a variable is_hungry is False or
 True and then prints a corresponding message based on its value.

Here's an explanation of the code step by step:

    is_hungry = False: This line of code initializes a boolean variable
 is_hungry and sets its value to False. In Python, a boolean variable can
 have two values: True or False. In this case, it's set to False, which
 means "not hungry."

    if (not is_hungry):: This line begins an if statement. The if statement 
checks whether the condition inside the parentheses is True or False. In this
 case, it's checking whether not is_hungry is True. The not keyword is used to
 negate the value of is_hungry,
 so it's checking if "not hungry" is True.

    print("You are not hungry"):: If the condition inside the if statement 

evaluates to True, which means that is_hungry is False, then this line is executed.
 It prints the message "You are not hungry" to the console.

    else:: If the condition inside the if statement evaluates to False, this 
line marks the start of the else block. In this case, it means that is_hungry is True.

    print("You are hungry"):: Inside the else block, this line is executed. 
It prints the message "You are hungry" to the console because is_hungry is 
True in this case.

Since you initialized is_hungry to False, the condition not is_hungry is True, 
and the code will print "You are not hungry" to the console. If you were to change 
the initial value of is_hungry to True, it would print "You are hungry" because the
 condition not is_hungry would then evaluate to False.

2. Which python operator means ‘less than or equal to’?
<=

3. Which of the following will evaluate to true?
False or True

4. What is the output of the following python code?
x = 6
y = 7
print(x == y)
solution
This code is a Python program that assigns the values 6 to the variable x 
and 7 to the variable y. Then, it checks whether x is equal to y using 
the == operator and prints the result. Here's the explanation step by step:

    x = 6: This line assigns the value 6 to the variable x. So, x now holds the value 6.

    y = 7: This line assigns the value 7 to the variable y. Now, y holds the value 7.

    print(x == y): This line contains a comparison using the == operator. 
It checks whether the value of x is equal to the value of y. In this case, 
it's checking if 6 is equal to 7. Since 6 is not equal to 7, this comparison 
evaluates to False.

    The print function is used to output the result of the comparison to the console.

So, when you run this code, it will print False to the console because x is not equal to y.

5. What is the output of the following python code?
x = 6
print(x > 7 or x < 12)
solution
True

6. Which python operator means ‘bigger than or equal to’?
=>

7. What will be the output of the following Python code?
is_hungry = True
if(not is_hungry):
  print("You are not hungry")
else:
  print("You are hungry")
Certainly! This code is a Python program that uses a conditional statement
 (an if statement) to check the value of the is_hungry variable and print a
 message based on its value. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

    is_hungry = True: This line initializes a boolean variable is_hungry and 
sets its value to True. In this context, True typically represents being hungry.

    if (not is_hungry):: This line begins an if statement. The if statement 
checks whether the condition inside the parentheses is True or False. In this 
case, it's checking whether not is_hungry is True. The not keyword is used to
 negate the 
value of is_hungry, so it's checking if "not hungry" is True.

    print("You are not hungry"):: If the condition inside the if statement 
evaluates to True, which means that is_hungry is False (because of the not), 
then this line is executed. It prints the message "You are not hungry" to the console.

    else:: If the condition inside the if statement evaluates to False, this
 line marks the start of the else block. In this case, it means that is_hungry is True.

    print("You are hungry"):: Inside the else block, this line is executed. 
It prints the message "You are hungry" to the console because is_hungry is True.

Since you initialized is_hungry to True, the condition not is_hungry evaluates to 
False, and the code will execute the else block. Therefore, when you run this code,
 it will print "You are hungry" to the console because is_hungry is True in this case.

BITWISE OPERATORS
1. What will be the output of the following Python expression?

5^11
solution

2. What will be the output of the following Python code snippet if x=2?
In Python, the << operator is used for bitwise left shift. When you shift a number
 left by a specified number of positions, it effectively multiplies the number by 2 
raised to the power of that number of positions.

In your code snippet, you have:

python

x = 2
result = x << 2

Here, you are shifting the value of x (which is 2) left by 2 positions. This is equivalent
 to multiplying 2 by 2 raised to the power of 2:

2 << 2 = 2 * (2^2) = 2 * 4 = 8
So, the output of the code x << 2 when x = 2 will be 8.

3. Bitwise _________ gives 1 if either of the bits is 1 and 0 when both of the bits are 0.
solution

The bitwise operation that gives 1 if either of the bits is 1 and 0 when both of the bits
 are 0 is called "bitwise OR," often denoted by the symbol "|".

In a bitwise OR operation, if either of the corresponding bits in the operands is 1, the resulting 
bit will be 1. Only when both bits are 0 will the resulting bit be 0.

Here's a truth table for bitwise OR:

css

| A | B | A | B | A OR B |
|---|---|---|---|-------|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |   0   |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |   1   |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |   1   |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |   1   |

    A bitwise OR of 0 and 0 gives 0.
    A bitwise OR of 0 and 1, or 1 and 0, gives 1.
    A bitwise OR of 1 and 1 gives 1.

4. What will be the output of the following Python code snippet if x=2 ?

x << 4

In Python, the << operator is used for bitwise left shift. When you shift a number left
 by a specified number of positions, it effectively multiplies the number by 2 raised to 
the power of that number of positions.

In your code snippet, you have:

python

x = 2
result = x << 4

Here, you are shifting the value of x (which is 2) left by 4 positions. This is equivalent to 
multiplying 2 by 2 raised to the power of 4:

2 << 4 = 2 * (2^4) = 2 * 16 = 32

5. Which of the following represents the bitwise XOR operator?
solution
 ^

6. What will be the output of the following Python expression?

~200

7. In Python, the ~ operator is used for bitwise negation or bitwise NOT. When you apply 
the ~ operator to a number x, it performs a bitwise negation where each bit in x is flipped (1s become 0s and vice versa).

For example:

python

~0 = -1
~1 = -2
~2 = -3
...

Now, let's consider your expression:

python

result = ~200

The number 200 in binary is 11001000. When we apply bitwise negation to 200, each bit is flipped:

makefile

Original:   11001000
Flipped:    00110111

In two's complement representation, which Python uses for signed integers, flipping the bits and 
interpreting it as a signed integer gives us the result. The flipped bits represent the value -57 in decimal.

So, the output of the expression ~200 in Python will be -201.

So, the output of the code x << 4 when x = 2 will be 32.

8. Which operator is used by the or() function?
solution
the pipe (|)

9. What will be the output of the following Python expression?

print(22 << 1)
 solution
The << operator in Python is used for bitwise left shift. When you shift a number left by a 
specified number of positions, it effectively multiplies the number by 2 raised to the power 
of that number of positions.

In your code snippet:

python

print(22 << 1)

You are shifting the value 22 left by 1 position. This is equivalent to multiplying 22 by 2 
raised to the power of 1:

22 << 1 = 22 * (2^1) = 22 * 2 = 44

So, the output of the expression print(22 << 1) will be 44.

10. Bitwise _________ gives 1 if both of the bits is 1 and 0 when either of the bits are 0.
solution
The bitwise operation that gives 1 if both of the bits are 1 and 0 when either of the bits is
 0 is called "bitwise AND," often denoted by the symbol &.

In a bitwise AND operation, both corresponding bits in the operands must be 1 for the resulting
 bit to be 1. If either or both bits are 0, the resulting bit will be 0.

Here's a truth table for bitwise AND:

css

| A | B | A AND B |
|---|---|---------|
| 0 | 0 |    0    |
| 0 | 1 |    0    |
| 1 | 0 |    0    |
| 1 | 1 |    1    |

    A bitwise AND of 0 and 0 gives 0.
    A bitwise AND of 0 and 1, or 1 and 0, gives 0.
    A bitwise AND of 1 and 1 gives 1.

11. What will be the output of the following Python code?

a = 20
b = 5
print("a & b =", a & b)
 solution
The code you provided calculates the bitwise AND (&) of two integers, a and b,
 and then prints the result. Here's what it does step by step:

    a = 20: This line assigns the value 20 to the variable a.

    b = 5: This line assigns the value 5 to the variable b.

    print("a & b =", a & b): This line calculates the bitwise AND of a and b using 
the & operator and then prints the result along with the text "a & b =".

Now, let's calculate the bitwise AND of 20 and 5:

In binary:

    a in binary is 10100.
    b in binary is 00101.

Performing bitwise AND:

markdown

  10100
& 00101
---------
  00100

12. What will be the output of the following Python code?

a = 20
b = 5
print("a | b =", a | b)

solution
The given Python code calculates and prints the result of a bitwise OR operation between
 two integer variables a and b. Here's what each part of the code does:

    a = 20: This line assigns the value 20 to the variable a.

    b = 5: This line assigns the value 5 to the variable b.

    print("a | b =", a | b): This line prints the result of the bitwise OR 
operation between a and b. The | operator performs a bitwise OR operation between 
corresponding bits of a and b. It sets each bit in the result to 1 if at least one 
of the corresponding bits in a or b is 1.

Let's break down the bitwise OR operation for these values:

    Binary representation of a (20 in decimal): 10100
    Binary representation of b (5 in decimal): 00101

Now, we perform the bitwise OR operation:

markdown

  10100
| 00101
---------
  10101

So, the result of a | b is 10101 in binary, which is equivalent to 21 in decimal.

The code will output:

css

a | b = 21

So, the output of the code will be:

css

a | b = 21

It tells us that the result of a | b is 21.


The result is 00100 in binary, which is equal to 4 in decimal.

So, the output of the code will be:

css

a & b = 4


It's stating that the bitwise AND of 20 and 5 is 4.

12. What will be the output of the following Python expression?

int(1001)
 solution

1001

13. Bitwise _________ gives 1 if either of the bits is 1 and 0 when both of the bits are 1.
