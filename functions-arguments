TIONS
1. Define a function that gets the user input and multiply it by a number we passed to the function.

Sample input:  6
Sample output: 

print( multi_num(5) )
30
Certainly! Here's a Python function that takes user input and multiplies
 it by a number passed as an argument to the function:

python

def multi_num(factor):
    user_input = input("Enter a number: ")
    try:
        user_input = float(user_input)  # Convert the user input to a floating-point number
        result = user_input * factor    # Multiply the user input by the factor
        return result
    except ValueError:
        return "Invalid input. Please enter a valid number."

# Example usage:
factor = 5
output = multi_num(factor)
print(output)

Let's break down how this code works:

    We define a function called multi_num that takes one argument,
 factor, which is the number you want to multiply the user's input by.

    Inside the function, we use the input function to get user input, 
and we prompt the user to enter a number.

    We then use a try block to handle any potential errors. We attempt 
to convert the user input to a floating-point number using float(user_input). 
If the user enters something that cannot be converted to a number
 (e.g., letters or symbols), a ValueError exception will be raised, and we'll 
handle it in the except block.

    If the conversion is successful, we multiply the user input by the factor 
and store the result in the result variable.

    Finally, we return the result as the output of the function.

    In the example usage at the bottom, we set factor to 5 and call the 
multi_num function with this factor. The function will prompt the user to
 enter a number, and it will then multiply that number by 5 (the factor).
 The result is printed to the console.

So, if you run this code and enter "6" as the user input, it will calculate
 6 * 5 and print the result, which is 30.

2. Choose the correct answer which defines a function to get numeric input from the user:
def input_num(): return int(input())

3. What is the output of the following snippet:

def my_function(*students):
  print("The tallest student is " + students[2])

my_function("James", "Ella", "Jackson")
 solution
The provided code defines a Python function called my_function that 
takes a variable number of arguments (students' names) and attempts to print
 the name of the third student. Here's the code with a step-by-step explanation:

python

def my_function(*students):
    print("The tallest student is " + students[2])

my_function("James", "Ella", "Jackson")

    We define a function named my_function that accepts a variable number
 of arguments, denoted by *students. This means you can pass any number of 
arguments when calling the function, and they will be collected into a tuple 
called students.

    Inside the function, we attempt to print a message that includes the name
 of the third student from the students tuple. The indexing [2] is used to access 
the third element because indexing in Python starts at 0. So, students[2] refers to the third student.

    Finally, we call my_function with three arguments: "James," "Ella," and "Jackson."

Now, let's see what happens when we run this code:

    The function my_function is called with three arguments: "James," "Ella," and "Jackson."

    Inside the function, these arguments are collected into a tuple named students.
 So, students will be ("James", "Ella", "Jackson").

    The function attempts to print "The tallest student is " concatenated with the 
name of the third student, which is students[2]. In this case, students[2] refers to "Jackson."

    Therefore, the output of the code will be:

    csharp

    The tallest student is Jackson

So, the code will print "The tallest student is Jackson" to the console.

4. What will be the result of calling the print_info function with the arguments ‘john’ and 19?

def print_info(name, age=18):
    print(name, age)

print_info('john', 19)
 solution

In this code, you have a function called print_info that takes two parameters: name and age. 
The age parameter has a default value of 18. Let's break down the code and explain it step by step:

python

def print_info(name, age=18):
    print(name, age)

print_info('john', 19)

    You define a function print_info that takes two parameters: name and age. 
name is a required parameter, while age is an optional parameter with a default value of 18.

    You call the print_info function with the arguments 'john' and 19. This means
 you are explicitly passing values for both name and age.

    Inside the function, the print function is used to print the values of name and age.

    In this specific function call, 'john' is passed as the value for name, and 19 
is passed as the value for age.

    Since you provided a value for age when calling the function, it overrides the
 default value of 18. Therefore, when the function is called with 'john' and 19,
 it prints those values:

    john 19

So, the output of the code will be john 19, as it prints both the provided name 
('john') and the explicitly provided age (19).

5. Regarding the definition of the function and the sample input, 
Choose the correct value of the output.

Function :  def multi_func(num1,num2):
                      return num1 *num2 
Sample input: print ( multi_func(5 , num1= 10) )

solution
The code you've provided defines a Python function called multi_func 
that takes two parameters, num1 and num2, and returns their product 
(num1 * num2). It also attempts to call this function with arguments
 and keyword arguments. Let's break it down and explain it:

python

def multi_func(num1, num2):
    return num1 * num2

# Attempt to call the function with arguments and keyword arguments
result = multi_func(5, num1=10)
print(result)

    You define a function called multi_func that takes two parameters, num1 and num2. 
Inside the function, it calculates the product of these two parameters (num1 * num2) 
and returns the result.

    You then attempt to call the multi_func function with the following arguments 
and keyword argument:
        5 is passed as the first positional argument, which corresponds to num1.
        num1=10 is passed as a keyword argument. In this case, you're explicitly 
specifying that num1 should have a value of 10.

    The function multi_func doesn't use the keyword argument num1 because num1 is
 already defined as a positional argument. The positional argument takes precedence 
over the keyword argument.

    So, when the function is called, it effectively becomes multi_func(5, 10),
 where 5 is assigned to num1 as a positional argument, and 10 is assigned to num2
 as a positional argument.

    The function calculates 5 * 10 and returns 50.

    The result (50) is stored in the result variable, and then it is printed to 
the console using print(result).

So, the correct value of the output is 50. The code will print 50 to the console.

6. The function can have only one parameter. If any data (parameters) are passed, they are passed explicitly.
Ans= False

7. Method is called by its name, but it is associated with an object.
Ans = True

8. The output of the following snippet of the code will be:

a = 0
def add_one(a):
	return a+1

result = add_one(a)
print(result)
Ans = 1

9. What is the error in the following snippet code:

def multi_func():
  result = int(input()) * 5
  return result     

print(result)

solution

In the provided code snippet, there is an error in the print statement because 
it attempts to print a variable result that is defined within the scope of the 
multi_func function. The result variable is not accessible outside the function. 
To fix this error, you can modify the code as follows:

python

def multi_func():
    result = int(input()) * 5
    return result

# Call the function and store its result in a variable
result_value = multi_func()

# Print the result
print(result_value)

Here's what I changed and why:

    I modified the print(result) statement to print(result_value). This 
change ensures that we are printing the result of the multi_func function, 
which is stored in the result_value variable.

    After defining the multi_func function, I called the function and stored
 its result in the result_value variable by assigning result_value = multi_func(). 
This way, we capture the result of the function call.

    Finally, I added a print(result_value) statement to print the result stored
 in result_value to the console.

With these changes, the code will correctly take user input, multiply it by 5,
 and print the result.

The result is not provided as a global variable.

ARGUMENTS
1. The output of the following snippet of the code will be:

def print_name_age(name, age=19):
    print(name, age)

print_name_age('john', 18)
solution
The provided code defines a Python function called print_name_age that takes two 
parameters: name and age. The age parameter has a default value of 19. Then, the 
code calls this function with specific arguments. Let's break it down and explain the code step by step:

python

def print_name_age(name, age=19):
    print(name, age)

print_name_age('john', 18)

    You define a function called print_name_age that takes two parameters, 
name and age. The age parameter has a default value of 19.

    You call the print_name_age function with the arguments 'john' and 18.
 When you call a function with specific arguments, those arguments override 
any default values for the parameters.

    Inside the function, the print function is used to print the values of name and age.

    In this specific function call, 'john' is passed as the value for name, 
and 18 is passed as the value for age. These values are used when the function is executed.

    Therefore, when the function is called with 'john' and 18, it prints those values:

    john 18

So, the output of the code will be john 18, as it prints both the provided name
 ('john') and the provided age (18). The default value of 19 for age is not used
 in this specific function call because you explicitly passed an age value of 18.


2. The output of the following snippet of the code will be:

def print_name_age(name, age=19):
    print(name, age)

print_name_age('john', 18)

Ans = John 18

3. Regarding the definition of the function and the sample input, Choose the correct value of the output.

Function :  def add_func(num1,num2):
            	  	return num1 + num2 
		
Sample input: print ( add_func(5 , 5) )
Ans = 10

4. Regarding the definition of the function and the sample input, 
Choose the correct value of the output.

Function :  def add_func(num1,num2):
                   	return num1 + num2
 
Sample input: print ( add_func(5 , num1= 10) ) 

Ans = Error

5. The output of the following snippet of the code will be:

nums= [7,4,1]
def change_third_item(list):
	list[2] = 5

change_third_item(nums)
print(nums)
 solution
[7,4,5]

6. What will be the result of calling the fullname_func function with the argument ‘John’?

def fullname_func(fname):
  print(fname + " Mark")

fullname_func("John")

Ans = John Mark

7. The output of the following snippet of the code will be:

a = 0
def add_three(a):
	return a+3

result = add_three(a)
print(result)

Ans = 3

8. The provided code defines a global variable a with a value of 0, and it also defines a function called add_three that takes a parameter a. The function adds 3 to the parameter a and returns the result. Then, it calls this function with the argument 3 and assigns the result to the variable result. Finally, it prints the value of result. Let's break it down and explain the code step by step:

python

a = 0  # Global variable 'a' with a value of 0

def add_three(a):
    return a + 3  # This function adds 3 to the parameter 'a' and returns the result

result = add_three(3)  # Call the 'add_three' function with the argument '3' 
and assign the result to 'result'

print(result)  # Print the value of 'result'

    You define a global variable a with a value of 0.

    You define a function called add_three that takes a parameter a. Inside the
 function, it adds 3 to the parameter a and returns the result.

    You call the add_three function with the argument 3. This means you're passing
 the value 3 as the parameter a when calling the function.

    Inside the function call, a takes on the value of 3, and the function adds 3 
to it. So, the result is 3 + 3, which equals 6.

    The result of the function call, 6, is assigned to the variable result.

    Finally, you print the value of result, which is 6.

So, the output of the code will be 6, as it prints the result of adding 3 to the value 
passed as an argument to the add_three function.

9. Define a function that gets the user input and add to it a number we passed to the function.

Sample input:  6
Sample output: 
print( add_num(5) )
11
Ans = def add_num(num): return int(input()) + num

10. What will be the result of calling the fullname_func function with the arguments ‘John’ and ‘Mark’?

def fullname_func(fname, lname):
  print(fname + " " + lname)

fullname_func("John", "Mark")

John Mark

11. What is the output of the following snippet:

def my_function(*friends):
  print("The tallest student is " + friends[0])

my_function("john", "Ella", "mark")

solution
The tallest student is john
